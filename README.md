The Tech Academy
JavaScript Final Project
Pizza Menu and Order Receipt Project 


Included in this project is a collection of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuerey and Bootstrap files - compiled to create a Pizza Menu Ordering system.


Version 1: Saturday - December 29, 2018
One Major Issue Unresolved:
The order menu will reprint when clicked multiple times. It would be preferred (for the standards and parameters set forth by the project's guidelines) if each subsequent push of the "order" button replaced/overlayed the previous receipt's output.
